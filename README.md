## Project Description
This report examines the trends of COVID-19 cases across different barangays in three Metro Manila cities during April 2021. The analysis includes:

- Comparative visualizations of COVID-19 statistics across cities
- Barangay-level analysis of case distributions
- Correlation between population density and infection rates
- Temporal trends throughout the month of April 2021

## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis was collected from:
- Pasig Public Information Office Facebook Page
- Malabon Official Facebook Page
- Quezon City's official website

## Key Findings
1. Higher population barangays generally showed higher case counts
2. Confirmed and recovered cases followed similar upward trends
3. Death rates remained relatively stable despite case increases
4. Active cases showed significant fluctuations throughout the month
5. By the end of April, all three cities showed a decrease in active cases

## Visualizations
The report includes multiple line charts showing:
- Barangay-level breakdowns for each city
- Comparative analysis across the three cities
- Temporal trends throughout April 2021

## Code Information
The visualizations were created using:
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly Express for interactive visualizations

## Actionable Insights
The report concludes with three key recommendations:
1. Stricter enforcement in high-population barangays
2. Modified guidelines for lower-population areas
3. Implementation of a "No Movement Sunday" policy similar to Cotabato LGU

## References
The report includes seven references to government sources, academic publications, and news reports that provide context for the analysis.
